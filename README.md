A Ethereum Smart Contract to allow the owner to split funds between two recipients.

Owner should be able to send value (if it is an odd number of Wei, return the 1 extra to the owner).  When the contract receives the amount, distribute the funds to the 2 recipients and keep track of totalSent and how much each recipient gets.
